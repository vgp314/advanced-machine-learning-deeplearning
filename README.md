# Advanced Machine Learning - Introdution to Deep Learning

# Week 1
**1) Programming assignment (Linear models, Optimization)**
In this programming assignment you will implement a linear classifier and train it using stochastic gradient descent modifications and numpy.

**2) Goals of the week**
- Train a linear model for classification or regression task using stochastic gradient descent
- Tune SGD optimization using different techniques
- Apply regularization to train better models
- Use linear models for classification and regression tasks

# Week 2
**1) MNIST digits classification with TensorFlow**

**2) Goals of the week:**

- Explain the mechanics of basic building blocks for neural networks
- Apply backpropagation algorithm to train deep neural networks using automatic differentiation
- Implement, train and test neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras

# Week 3

**1) In this task you will build your first Convolutional Neural Network! More specifically you will do the following:**
   - 1.1 Define your first CNN architecture for CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 32x32 colour images from 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck;
   - 1.2 Train it from scratch, observing the decrease of the loss for several hours :)
   - 1.3 Visualise learnt filters;
   
**2) In this task you will fine-tune InceptionV3 architecture for flowers classification task.**

- InceptionV3 architecture ( https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html ):
- Flowers classification dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) consists of 102 flower categories commonly occurring in the United Kingdom. Each class contains between 40 and 258 images.   

**3) Goals of the week**

- Define and train a CNN from scratch
- Understand building blocks and training tricks of modern CNNs
- Use pre-trained CNN to solve a new task
   
# Week 4

**1) In this task you will train your own autoencoder for human faces!**

**2) Goals of the week**

- Understand what is unsupervised learning and how you can benifit from it
- Implement and train deep autoencoders
- Apply autoencoders for image retrieval and image morphing
- Implement and train generative adversarial networks
- Understand basics of unsupervised learning of word embeddings

# Week 5

**1) Generating names with recurrent neural networks.**

**2) Goals of the week**
- Define and train an RNN from scratch
- Understand modern architectures of RNNs: LSTM, GRU
- Use RNNs for different types of tasks: sequential input, sequential output, sequential input and output

# Week 6

**1) In this final project you will define and train an image-to-caption model, that can produce descriptions for real world images!**

- Model architecture: CNN encoder and RNN decoder. (https://research.googleblog.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html)
